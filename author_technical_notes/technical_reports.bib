	abstract = {Nurse rostering is a complex scheduling problem that affects hospital personnel on a daily basis all over the world. The need for quality software solutions is acute for a number of reasons. In particular, it is very important to efficiently utilise time and effort, to evenly balance the workload among people and to attempt to satisfy personnel preferences. A high quality roster can lead to a more contented and thus more effective workforce.},

@article{Thongsopa_Janjarassuk_2021, title={Optimization of Nurse Scheduling Problem: A hospital case study}, volume={38}, url={https://ph01.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/lej/article/view/245111}, abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nurse Scheduling is a complicated task which highly relies on the experience of scheduler. It usually takes a long time to finish the task. The chance of human error is high, resulting in unbalanced workloads among nurses and inconsistency with the requirements of the hospital. Therefore, this research examines the nurse scheduling problems in order to find a way to assign nurses to shifts properly, and to solve the unbalanced workload problem. A mixed-integer linear program was used to experiment with the case study problem in a hospital. The results showed that the difference in workload among nurses can be reduced from three shifts to only one shift with the help of the mathematical model. In terms of the difference in workload measured by the standard deviation, it was reduced from 0.790 to 0.444. In conclusion, the proposed mathematical model is capable of covering all scheduling conditions of the hospital. It also helps distribute the workloads of nurses effectively.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={4}, journal={Ladkrabang Engineering Journal}, author={Thongsopa, Kantaporn and Janjarassuk, Udom}, year={2021}, month={Dec.}, pages={23â€“32} }
